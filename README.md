SesameStick
===========

This is a small Minecraft Server Plugin (Spigot, Paper) that allows you to
permanently keep Chests and Barrels open for decoration purposes.
It works on Shulker boxes as well, where it isn't 100% decorative only;
you can build staircases of alternating closed/opened shulkers now!

Rename a stick to "Sesame Open" in an anvil. Right click containers with the
stick to keep them open permanently.

Rename another stick to "Sesame Close" to close the containers you opened with
the first stick.
